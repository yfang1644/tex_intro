  volume    = {2},
  abstract  = {The paper discusses the feasibility of coding an "undetectable" digital water mark on a standard 512/spl times/512 intensity image with an 8 bit gray scale. The watermark is capable of carrying such information as authentication or authorisation codes, or a legend essential for image interpretation. This capability is envisaged to find application in image tagging, copyright enforcement, counterfeit protection, and controlled access. Two methods of implementation are discussed. The first is based on bit plane manipulation of the LSB, which offers easy and rapid decoding. The second method utilises linear addition of the water mark to the image data, and is more difficult to decode, offering inherent security. This linearity property also allows some image processing, such as averaging, to take place on the image, without corrupting the water mark beyond recovery. Either method is potentially compatible with JPEG and MPEG processing.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents a secure (tamper-resistant) algorithm for watermarking images, and a methodology for digital watermarking that may be generalized to audio, video, and multimedia data. We advocate that a watermark should be constructed as an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian random vector that is imperceptibly inserted in a spread-spectrum-like fashion into the perceptually most significant spectral components of the data. We argue that insertion of a watermark under this regime makes the watermark robust to signal processing operations (such as lossy compression, filtering, digital-analog and analog-digital conversion, requantization, etc.), and common geometric transformations (such as cropping, scaling, translation, and rotation) provided that the original image is available and that it can be successfully registered against the transformed watermarked image. In these cases, the watermark detector unambiguously identifies the owner. Further, the use of Gaussian noise, ensures strong resilience to multiple-document, or collusional, attacks. Experimental results are provided to support these claims, along with an exposition of pending open problems.},

Watermarking is a technique used to label digital media by hiding copyright or other information into the underlying data. The watermark must be imperceptible or undetectable by the user and should be robust to attacks and other types of distortion. In our method, the watermark is generated by filtering a PN-sequence with a filter that approximates the frequency masking characteristics of the human auditory system. It is then weighted in the time domain to account for temporal masking. We discuss the detection of the watermark and assess the robustness of our watermarking approach to attacks and various signal manipulations.},

The novel technology of embedding image data into the audio signal and additive audio watermarking algorithm based on DCT domain is proposed. AC DCT coefficients play different influence in robust and inaudibility. First, we decompose the audio into no overlapping blocks (eight data per block). Then every block performs the DCT operation: watermark is embedded by modulating AC DCT coefficient. Every block is embedded one bit message. Experimental results demonstrate that the watermark is inaudible and this algorithm is robust to common operations of digital audio signal processing, such as low-pass filtering, smoothing, adding noise and so on. The extracted watermark image quality is showed by considering normalize correlation (NC) value with a suitable scaling parameter for embedding.},

  booktitle = {Computer Engineering \& Systems},

  pages     = {207-212},
  abstract  = {To enhance security and robustness of digital audio watermarking  algorithms,  this  paper  presents  an  algorithm based  on  mean-quantization  in  Discrete  Wavelet  Transform (DWT) domain. A binary image is used as a watermark, and is encrypted   with chaotic  encryption with secret key. This approach is  based  on the embedding   of  an  encrypted watermark  in  the  low  frequency  components  using  a  two  wavelet functions with adaptation to the frame size. The reason for  embedding  the  watermark in the low frequency components is that these components’ energy is high enough to embed  the  watermark  in  such  a  way  that  the  watermark  is inaudible; therefore, it should not alter the audible content and should  not  be  easy  to  remove.  The  algorithm  has  a  good security  because  only  the  authorized  can  detect  the  copyright information embedded to the host audio signal. The watermark  can  be  blindly  extracted  without knowledge  of  the  original  signal. To evaluate  the  performance  of  the  presented  audio  watermarking  method,  objective quality tests  including  bit error  rate (BER),  normalized   cross orrelation(NCC),   peak-signal  to noise ratio (PSNR) are conducted  for  the watermark and  Signal-to-Noise  Ratio(SNR) for  audio  signals.  The tests’ results show that the approach maintains high audio quality,   and   yields   a   high   recovery   rate   after   attacks   by   commonly used   audio   data   manipulations   such   as  noise addition,  amplitude    modification,    low-pass    filtering,    re-quantization, re-sampling, cropping, cutting, and compression. Simulation results show that our approach not only makes sure robustness   against   common   attacks,   but   it   also   further  improves  systemic  security  and  robustness  against  malicious  attack.},
